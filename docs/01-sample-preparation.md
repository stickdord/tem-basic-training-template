# Module 1: Sample Preparation

## Introduction
Proper sample preparation is crucial for obtaining high-quality TEM images. The sample must be thin enough (typically < 100 nm) to allow electrons to pass through while preserving the structure of interest.

## Common Sample Types
- **Powder/Nanoparticles**: Dispersed on a carbon-coated copper grid.
- **Bulk materials**: Thinned by mechanical polishing, ion milling, or focused ion beam (FIB).
- **Biological tissues**: Fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, and sectioned with an ultramicrotome.

## Basic Steps for Particulate Samples (e.g., Gold Nanoparticles)
1. **Select a suitable grid**: A 3‑mm copper grid with a thin carbon support film is typical.
2. **Clean the grid**: Use plasma cleaning or UV‑ozone treatment to reduce contamination.
3. **Prepare the suspension**: Dilute your sample (e.g., nanoparticles) in a volatile solvent (ethanol, water) to avoid aggregation.
4. **Apply the sample**:
   - Place a small droplet (2‑5 µL) of the suspension onto the carbon film.
   - Let it sit for 30–60 seconds.
   - Gently wick away excess liquid with filter paper.
   - Allow the grid to air‑dry completely.
5. **Optional post‑treatment**: Lightly carbon‑coat the grid to improve stability.

## Important Considerations
- **Grid handling**: Always hold grids with fine tweezers by the rim to avoid damaging the support film.
- **Contamination**: Work in a clean environment (e.g., laminar flow hood) to minimize dust.
- **Sample concentration**: Too high a concentration leads to overlapping particles; too low yields few features of interest.

## Safety
- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, lab coat, safety glasses).
- Follow chemical‑safety protocols for any solvents or fixatives used.

## Practice Task
Prepare a carbon‑coated copper grid with a drop‑cast suspension of gold nanoparticles (provided). Examine the grid under an optical microscope to verify that the nanoparticles are evenly distributed before proceeding to TEM insertion.
