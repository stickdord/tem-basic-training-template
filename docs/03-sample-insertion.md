# Module 3: Sample Insertion

## Introduction
Inserting a sample into the TEM column is a delicate operation that requires careful attention to avoid damaging the column, the specimen holder, or the sample itself. This module outlines the general steps for safely loading a specimen holder into a TEM. **Always follow the specific instructions for your microscope model and seek supervision during your first attempts.**

## Pre‑Insertion Checks
1. **Vacuum status**: Ensure the column is under high vacuum (typically indicated by green lights on the vacuum panel). Never attempt insertion if the column is vented.
2. **Cold trap**: If your TEM uses a cold trap, fill it with liquid nitrogen before starting.
3. **Holder identification**: Verify that you have the correct holder (single‑tilt, double‑tilt, heating, etc.) and that the sample is securely mounted in the holder.
4. **Stage position**: Using the stage controls, bring the current holder (if any) to its home position (tilt angles at 0°, translation centered). Reset the holder if required by the software.

## Removing the Current Holder (if present)
1. **Close column valves** (if your TEM has separate valves for the column and camera).
2. **Reset the holder** via the software to return tilts to zero and retract the stage.
3. **Stand up** to have a clear view and steady hands.
4. **Disconnect any cables** (e.g., beta‑tilt cable for double‑tilt holders).
5. **Press the retention plate** (often a purple or black lever) with one hand while gently pulling the specimen rod straight out until you feel a stop.
6. **Rotate the rod clockwise** (usually a quarter‑turn) until it stops.
7. **Press the retention plate again** and pull the rod slightly further to break the vacuum seal of the specimen exchange chamber.
8. **Slowly withdraw the rod completely** and place it in a safe holder rack.

## Inserting a New Specimen Holder
**Critical Step**: Align the orientation pin on the specimen rod with the marked position on the specimen exchange chamber (often the “3 o’clock” position). Misalignment can damage the delicate seals.

1. **Confirm column valves are closed** (safety interlock should be engaged).
2. **Align the pin** with the designated start position (e.g., 3 o’clock).
3. **Slide the rod straight in** until it stops (do not force).
4. **Rotate the rod clockwise** (typically about 120°) until the pin reaches the “close” mark (e.g., 5 o’clock). You should feel a slight resistance as the rod moves slightly further inward.
5. **Push the rod gently an additional small distance** (≈ 0.25 inch) until it sits snugly. A red LED on the chamber may light to indicate proper insertion.
6. **Re‑connect any cables** (e.g., beta‑tilt cable) if needed.
7. **In the TEM software**, select the specimen holder type and confirm the connection.
8. **Wait for the pump‑down cycle** (if your TEM has an automatic pump). The vacuum system will evacuate the exchange chamber; a timer or LED will indicate when pumping is complete.
9. **Rotate the rod counter‑clockwise** back to the “open” position (e.g., 12 o’clock). The rod will be drawn into the column by the vacuum.
10. **Allow the rod to slide fully into the column**; the stage motors will then engage.

## Post‑Insertion Verification
1. **Open the column valves** (after vacuum reaches an acceptable level).
2. **Check the beam**: Increase the beam intensity slowly; you should see illumination on the viewing screen.
3. **Navigate to your sample**: Use the stage controls to move to a region of interest. Start at low magnification (e.g., 500–2000×) to locate the sample.

## Safety Reminders
- **Never force the rod** – if you meet unexpected resistance, stop and ask for help.
- **Keep the column under vacuum** – accidental venting can introduce contaminants and damage the filament.
- **Handle holders with care** – avoid touching the delicate sealing surfaces or the sample grid.
- **Always wear gloves** to prevent skin oils from contaminating the holder or sample.

## Practice Task
Under supervision, practice removing and inserting a dummy (empty) specimen holder. Repeat the alignment steps until you can perform them smoothly without hesitation.
