# Module 2: Microscope Parts

## Introduction
A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) consists of several key components that work together to generate a magnified image of an ultra‑thin specimen. Understanding these parts is essential for safe and effective operation.

## Major Components

### 1. Electron Source (Gun)
- **Purpose**: Emits a beam of electrons.
- **Common types**:
  - **Thermionic (tungsten or LaB₆)**: Heated filament releases electrons.
  - **Field‑emission (FEG)**: Extremely bright, coherent source.
- The gun is located at the top of the column and is under high vacuum.

### 2. Condenser Lens System
- **Purpose**: Shapes and controls the electron beam before it reaches the specimen.
- **Components**:
  - **Condenser lens 1 (C1)**: Controls the spot size (beam diameter).
  - **Condenser lens 2 (C2)**: Controls the beam intensity (current) and convergence angle.
- **Condenser aperture**: A small metallic disk with a central hole that limits the beam’s convergence angle, reducing spherical aberration and controlling beam current.

### 3. Specimen Stage
- **Purpose**: Holds the sample grid and allows precise positioning.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **X‑Y translation**: Move the sample laterally.
  - **Z‑height (eucentric)**: Bring the region of interest to the focal plane.
  - **Tilt (single‑ or double‑tilt)**: Change the sample orientation for diffraction or tomography.
- The stage is inserted into the objective lens gap.

### 4. Objective Lens
- **Purpose**: The most critical lens for forming the first magnified image.
- **Functions**:
  - Focuses the electrons that have passed through the specimen.
  - Determines the ultimate resolution of the microscope.
  - Contains the **objective aperture** (see below).
- **Objective aperture**: A small selectable aperture placed at the back‑focal plane of the objective lens. It blocks scattered electrons, thereby enhancing image contrast (amplitude contrast).

### 5. Intermediate and Projector Lenses
- **Purpose**: Further magnify the image formed by the objective lens.
- **Intermediate lens**: Allows switching between imaging and diffraction modes.
- **Projector lens(es)**: Project the final image onto the viewing screen or camera.

### 6. Apertures Overview
Three main apertures are used routinely:

| Aperture          | Location                  | Primary Function                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Condenser**     | Below condenser lens(es)  | Limits beam convergence; reduces spherical aberration; controls beam intensity.  |
| **Objective**     | Back‑focal plane of objective lens | Selectively blocks scattered electrons to improve contrast (amplitude contrast). |
| **Selected‑area** | Image plane of objective  | Allows diffraction from a small, chosen region of the specimen.                  |

### 7. Detection / Recording System
- **Fluorescent screen**: For direct visual observation.
- **CCD / CMOS camera**: Digital image capture.
- **Other detectors**: STEM detectors, EDS (energy‑dispersive X‑ray spectrometer) for elemental analysis.

## Safety Notes
- The column is under high vacuum (≈10⁻⁷ mbar). Never vent the column without proper procedure.
- The electron gun operates at high voltage (typically 80–300 kV). Respect all high‑voltage safety interlocks.
- X‑rays are produced when electrons strike metal parts; the column is shielded, but do not bypass shielding.

## Practice Task
Identify each major component on the TEM you will be using. Locate the controls for the condenser lenses, objective lens, and the aperture selector. With the beam off, practice inserting and removing a dummy sample rod (if available).
