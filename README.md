# TEM Basic Training Workflow

Welcome to the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) basic training workflow. This repository serves as a self-contained training module for new technicians and researchers to learn fundamental TEM operation for simple imaging.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - This file, outlining the training process.
- `docs/` - Directory containing detailed modules:
  - `01-sample-preparation.md` - Sample preparation guidelines.
  - `02-microscope-parts.md` - Overview of TEM main components.
  - `03-sample-insertion.md` - Step-by-step sample insertion procedure.
  - `04-alignment-and-controls.md` - Alignment, focus, stigmation, magnification controls.
  - `05-image-acquisition.md` - How to acquire a high-quality image.
- `submissions/` - Directory for final image submissions.

## Training Workflow

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account (if you haven't already).
2. **Clone your fork** locally and explore the `docs/` directory.
3. **Work through each module** in order, using the microscope under supervision.
4. **Document your progress** by creating GitHub Issues as described below.
5. **Acquire a practice image** following Module 5 instructions.
6. **Submit your image** via a Pull Request to the `main` branch.

## Progress Tracking with Issues

As you complete each module, create corresponding GitHub Issues in your forked repository:

- **Module 1 & 2**: Create an issue titled `Task: Initial Knowledge Check` with answers to the questions listed in the module.
- **Module 3**: Create an issue titled `Task: Sample Insertion Complete` describing the critical safety step.
- **Module 4**: Create an issue titled `Task: Alignment Proficiency` answering the alignment questions.

Label the issues appropriately (`module-1-2`, `module-3`, `module-4`, `knowledge-check`, `practical`).

## Final Demonstration

After acquiring a high-quality image (e.g., gold nanoparticles on carbon film), add the image to the `submissions/` directory and update `submissions/README.md` with your metadata. Then create a new branch, commit your changes, and open a Pull Request to the `main` branch.

Your PR title should be `TEM Training Submission - [Your Name]` and include the checklist confirming image quality.

## Review Process

A lab manager or senior researcher will review your Pull Request, check the image quality, and merge it upon successful completion. This marks the end of your basic TEM training.

## Getting Help

If you encounter problems, consult the microscope manual or ask a senior lab member. For repository-related issues, open an Issue in this repository.

Good luck!
